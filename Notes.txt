Validators 
	how to execute them

U can not make query or command for mulitple handlers

in ngsql u should make the query like this 
                SELECT
                "Content" as Content, // "content"  or Content is wrong 
                "CreatedAt" AS CreatedAt,
                "UserProfileId" as UserProfileId
                from "PostComment"
                where "postId"=@PostId

Please don't make the response class internal like this:
    internal class GetPostInteractionsResponse
    {
        public Guid PostId { get; init; }
        public List<InteractionInfo> InteractionInfos { get; init; }
    }
    Because when I try to return this response from the controller, it cannot be accessed.

Make commands and queries public 
Make data types of commands or queries is primtive
